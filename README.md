# Ahorcado

This project is a simple hangman game developed using ReactJS and Vite. The game allows players to guess a word by entering letters. The player wins the game by guessing all the letters in the word correctly before making too many mistakes.

The game starts by entering a word or phrase to be guessed. Spaces between words are automatically converted to dashes to indicate the number of words in the phrase. Players can then enter letters to guess the word. Correctly guessed letters are revealed in the word, while incorrect guesses increase the number of mistakes.

The game provides feedback on the of the correct letters, the number of mistakes (if mistakes are three the player will be lost), and whether the player has won or lost. It is a fun and interactive way to test your vocabulary and spelling skills.
